# rescv
Resume/CV template project!
This initially started as me just converting my resume into a webpage so it's always accessable, but I decided to just keep it as a template to share with anyone in case they liked it and wanted to have something similar for themselves.
It's simple html/css so nothing complex at all.

The idea was to make it looks like an actual real life piece of paper resume that you'd see on a desk. :)
The margins might be off from a standard printed paper, but I guess it's okay.

fontawesome icons are used, they seem to fit well.
